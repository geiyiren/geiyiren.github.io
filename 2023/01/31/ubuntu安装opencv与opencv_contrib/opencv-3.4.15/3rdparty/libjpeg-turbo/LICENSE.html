<h1 id="libjpeg-turbo-Licenses"><a href="#libjpeg-turbo-Licenses" class="headerlink" title="libjpeg-turbo Licenses"></a>libjpeg-turbo Licenses</h1><p>libjpeg-turbo is covered by three compatible BSD-style open source licenses:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The IJG (Independent JPEG Group) License, which is listed in<br><a href="README.ijg">README.ijg</a></p>
<p>This license applies to the libjpeg API library and associated programs<br>(any code inherited from libjpeg, and any modifications to that code.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Modified (3-clause) BSD License, which is listed below</p>
<p>This license covers the TurboJPEG API library and associated programs, as<br>well as the build system.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib">zlib License</a></p>
<p>This license is a subset of the other two, and it covers the libjpeg-turbo<br>SIMD extensions.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="Why-Three-Licenses"><a href="#Why-Three-Licenses" class="headerlink" title="Why Three Licenses?"></a>Why Three Licenses?</h1><p>The zlib License could have been used instead of the Modified (3-clause) BSD<br>License, and since the IJG License effectively subsumes the distribution<br>conditions of the zlib License, this would have effectively placed<br>libjpeg-turbo binary distributions under the IJG License.  However, the IJG<br>License specifically refers to the Independent JPEG Group and does not extend<br>attribution and endorsement protections to other entities.  Thus, it was<br>desirable to choose a license that granted us the same protections for new code<br>that were granted to the IJG for code derived from their software.</p>
