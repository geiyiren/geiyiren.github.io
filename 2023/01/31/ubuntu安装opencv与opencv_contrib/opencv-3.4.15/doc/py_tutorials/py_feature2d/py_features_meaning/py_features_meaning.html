<h2 id="Explanation"><a href="#Explanation" class="headerlink" title="Explanation"></a>Explanation</h2><p>Most of you will have played the jigsaw puzzle games. You get a lot of small pieces of an image,<br>where you need to assemble them correctly to form a big real image. <strong>The question is, how you do<br>it?</strong> What about the projecting the same theory to a computer program so that computer can play<br>jigsaw puzzles? If the computer can play jigsaw puzzles, why can’t we give a lot of real-life images<br>of a good natural scenery to computer and tell it to stitch all those images to a big single image?<br>If the computer can stitch several natural images to one, what about giving a lot of pictures of a<br>building or any structure and tell computer to create a 3D model out of it?</p>
<p>Well, the questions and imaginations continue. But it all depends on the most basic question: How do<br>you play jigsaw puzzles? How do you arrange lots of scrambled image pieces into a big single image?<br>How can you stitch a lot of natural images to a single image?</p>
<p>The answer is, we are looking for specific patterns or specific features which are unique, can<br>be easily tracked and can be easily compared. If we go for a definition of such a feature, we may<br>find it difficult to express it in words, but we know what they are. If someone asks you to point<br>out one good feature which can be compared across several images, you can point out one. That is<br>why even small children can simply play these games. We search for these features in an image,<br>find them, look for the same features in other images and align them. That’s it. (In jigsaw puzzle,<br>we look more into continuity of different images). All these abilities are present in us inherently.</p>
<p>So our one basic question expands to more in number, but becomes more specific. <strong>What are these<br>features?</strong>. (The answer should be understandable also to a computer.)</p>
<p>It is difficult to say how humans find these features. This is already programmed in our brain.<br>But if we look deep into some pictures and search for different patterns, we will find something<br>interesting. For example, take below image:</p>
<p><img src="/images/feature_building.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>The image is very simple. At the top of image, six small image patches are given. Question for you is to<br>find the exact location of these patches in the original image. How many correct results can you<br>find?</p>
<p>A and B are flat surfaces and they are spread over a lot of area. It is difficult to find the exact<br>location of these patches.</p>
<p>C and D are much more simple. They are edges of the building. You can find an approximate location,<br>but exact location is still difficult. This is because the pattern is same everywhere along the edge.<br>At the edge, however, it is different. An edge is therefore better feature compared to flat area, but<br>not good enough (It is good in jigsaw puzzle for comparing continuity of edges).</p>
<p>Finally, E and F are some corners of the building. And they can be easily found. Because at the<br>corners, wherever you move this patch, it will look different. So they can be considered as good<br>features. So now we move into simpler (and widely used image) for better understanding.</p>
<p><img src="/images/feature_simple.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>Just like above, the blue patch is flat area and difficult to find and track. Wherever you move the blue<br>patch it looks the same. The black patch has an edge. If you move it in vertical direction (i.e.<br>along the gradient) it changes. Moved along the edge (parallel to edge), it looks the same. And for<br>red patch, it is a corner. Wherever you move the patch, it looks different, means it is unique. So<br>basically, corners are considered to be good features in an image. (Not just corners, in some cases<br>blobs are considered good features).</p>
<p>So now we answered our question, “what are these features?”. But next question arises. How do we<br>find them? Or how do we find the corners?. We answered that in an intuitive way, i.e., look for<br>the regions in images which have maximum variation when moved (by a small amount) in all regions<br>around it. This would be projected into computer language in coming chapters. So finding these image<br>features is called <strong>Feature Detection</strong>.</p>
<p>We found the features in the images. Once you have found it, you should be able to find the same<br>in the other images. How is this done? We take a region around the feature, we explain it in our own<br>words, like “upper part is blue sky, lower part is region from a building, on that building there is<br>glass etc” and you search for the same area in the other images. Basically, you are describing the<br>feature. Similarly, a computer also should describe the region around the feature so that it can<br>find it in other images. So called description is called <strong>Feature Description</strong>. Once you have the<br>features and its description, you can find same features in all images and align them, stitch them together<br>or do whatever you want.</p>
<p>So in this module, we are looking to different algorithms in OpenCV to find features, describe them,<br>match them etc.</p>
