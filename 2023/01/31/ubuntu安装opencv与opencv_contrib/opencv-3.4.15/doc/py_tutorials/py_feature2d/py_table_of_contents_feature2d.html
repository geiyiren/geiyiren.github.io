<li><p>@subpage tutorial_py_features_meaning</p>
<p>What are the main<br>features in an image? How can finding those features be useful to us?</p>
</li>
<li><p>@subpage tutorial_py_features_harris</p>
<p>Okay, Corners are good<br>features? But how do we find them?</p>
</li>
<li><p>@subpage tutorial_py_shi_tomasi</p>
<p>We will look into<br>Shi-Tomasi corner detection</p>
</li>
<li><p>@subpage tutorial_py_sift_intro</p>
<p>Harris corner detector<br>is not good enough when scale of image changes. Lowe developed a breakthrough method to find<br>scale-invariant features and it is called SIFT</p>
</li>
<li><p>@subpage tutorial_py_surf_intro</p>
<p>SIFT is really good,<br>but not fast enough, so people came up with a speeded-up version called SURF.</p>
</li>
<li><p>@subpage tutorial_py_fast</p>
<p>All the above feature<br>detection methods are good in some way. But they are not fast enough to work in real-time<br>applications like SLAM. There comes the FAST algorithm, which is really “FAST”.</p>
</li>
<li><p>@subpage tutorial_py_brief</p>
<p>SIFT uses a feature<br>descriptor with 128 floating point numbers. Consider thousands of such features. It takes lots of<br>memory and more time for matching. We can compress it to make it faster. But still we have to<br>calculate it first. There comes BRIEF which gives the shortcut to find binary descriptors with<br>less memory, faster matching, still higher recognition rate.</p>
</li>
<li><p>@subpage tutorial_py_orb</p>
<p>SIFT and SURF are good in what they do, but what if you have to pay a few dollars every year to use them in your applications? Yeah, they are patented!!! To solve that problem, OpenCV devs came up with a new “FREE” alternative to SIFT &amp; SURF, and that is ORB.</p>
</li>
<li><p>@subpage tutorial_py_matcher</p>
<p>We know a great deal about feature detectors and descriptors. It is time to learn how to match different descriptors. OpenCV provides two techniques, Brute-Force matcher and FLANN based matcher.</p>
</li>
<li><p>@subpage tutorial_py_feature_homography</p>
<p>Now we know about feature matching. Let’s mix it up with calib3d module to find objects in a complex image.</p>
