It will be helpful in coming<br>chapters.</p>
<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>In the first article, we calculated and plotted one-dimensional histogram. It is called<br>one-dimensional because we are taking only one feature into our consideration, ie grayscale<br>intensity value of the pixel. But in two-dimensional histograms, you consider two features. Normally<br>it is used for finding color histograms where two features are Hue &amp; Saturation values of every<br>pixel.</p>
<p>There is a python sample (samples&#x2F;python&#x2F;color_histogram.py) already<br>for finding color histograms. We will try to understand how to create such a color histogram, and it<br>will be useful in understanding further topics like Histogram Back-Projection.</p>
<h2 id="2D-Histogram-in-OpenCV"><a href="#2D-Histogram-in-OpenCV" class="headerlink" title="2D Histogram in OpenCV"></a>2D Histogram in OpenCV</h2><p>It is quite simple and calculated using the same function, <strong>cv.calcHist()</strong>. For color histograms,<br>we need to convert the image from BGR to HSV. (Remember, for 1D histogram, we converted from BGR to<br>Grayscale). For 2D histograms, its parameters will be modified as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>channels &#x3D; [0,1]</strong> <em>because we need to process both H and S plane.</em></li>
<li><strong>bins &#x3D; [180,256]</strong> <em>180 for H plane and 256 for S plane.</em></li>
<li><strong>range &#x3D; [0,180,0,256]</strong> <em>Hue value lies between 0 and 180 &amp; Saturation lies between 0 and<br>256.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Now check the code below:<br>@code{.py}<br>import numpy as np<br>import cv2 as cv</p>
<p>img &#x3D; cv.imread(‘home.jpg’)<br>hsv &#x3D; cv.cvtColor(img,cv.COLOR_BGR2HSV)</p>
<p>hist &#x3D; cv.calcHist([hsv], [0, 1], None, [180, 256], [0, 180, 0, 256])<br>@endcode<br>That’s it.</p>
<h2 id="2D-Histogram-in-Numpy"><a href="#2D-Histogram-in-Numpy" class="headerlink" title="2D Histogram in Numpy"></a>2D Histogram in Numpy</h2><p>Numpy also provides a specific function for this : <strong>np.histogram2d()</strong>. (Remember, for 1D histogram<br>we used <strong>np.histogram()</strong> ).<br>@code{.py}<br>import numpy as np<br>import cv2 as cv<br>from matplotlib import pyplot as plt</p>
<p>img &#x3D; cv.imread(‘home.jpg’)<br>hsv &#x3D; cv.cvtColor(img,cv.COLOR_BGR2HSV)</p>
<p>hist, xbins, ybins &#x3D; np.histogram2d(h.ravel(),s.ravel(),[180,256],[[0,180],[0,256]])<br>@endcode<br>First argument is H plane, second one is the S plane, third is number of bins for each and fourth is<br>their range.</p>
<p>Now we can check how to plot this color histogram.</p>
<h2 id="Plotting-2D-Histograms"><a href="#Plotting-2D-Histograms" class="headerlink" title="Plotting 2D Histograms"></a>Plotting 2D Histograms</h2><h3 id="Method-1-Using-cv-imshow"><a href="#Method-1-Using-cv-imshow" class="headerlink" title="Method - 1 : Using cv.imshow()"></a>Method - 1 : Using cv.imshow()</h3><p>The result we get is a two dimensional array of size 180x256. So we can show them as we do normally,<br>using cv.imshow() function. It will be a grayscale image and it won’t give much idea what colors<br>are there, unless you know the Hue values of different colors.</p>
<h3 id="Method-2-Using-Matplotlib"><a href="#Method-2-Using-Matplotlib" class="headerlink" title="Method - 2 : Using Matplotlib"></a>Method - 2 : Using Matplotlib</h3><p>We can use <strong>matplotlib.pyplot.imshow()</strong> function to plot 2D histogram with different color maps.<br>It gives us a much better idea about the different pixel density. But this also, doesn’t gives us<br>idea what color is there on a first look, unless you know the Hue values of different colors. Still<br>I prefer this method. It is simple and better.</p>
<p>@note While using this function, remember, interpolation flag should be nearest for better results.</p>
<p>Consider code:<br>@code{.py}<br>import numpy as np<br>import cv2 as cv<br>from matplotlib import pyplot as plt</p>
<p>img &#x3D; cv.imread(‘home.jpg’)<br>hsv &#x3D; cv.cvtColor(img,cv.COLOR_BGR2HSV)<br>hist &#x3D; cv.calcHist( [hsv], [0, 1], None, [180, 256], [0, 180, 0, 256] )</p>
<p>plt.imshow(hist,interpolation &#x3D; ‘nearest’)<br>plt.show()<br>@endcode<br>Below is the input image and its color histogram plot. X axis shows S values and Y axis shows Hue.</p>

<p>In histogram, you can see some high values near H &#x3D; 100 and S &#x3D; 200. It corresponds to blue of sky.<br>Similarly another peak can be seen near H &#x3D; 25 and S &#x3D; 100. It corresponds to yellow of the palace.<br>You can verify it with any image editing tools like GIMP.</p>
<h3 id="Method-3-OpenCV-sample-style"><a href="#Method-3-OpenCV-sample-style" class="headerlink" title="Method 3 : OpenCV sample style !!"></a>Method 3 : OpenCV sample style !!</h3><p>There is a sample code for color-histogram in OpenCV-Python2 samples<br>(samples&#x2F;python&#x2F;color_histogram.py).<br>If you run the code, you can see the histogram shows the corresponding color also.<br>Or simply it outputs a color coded histogram.<br>Its result is very good (although you need to add extra bunch of lines).</p>
<p>In that code, the author created a color map in HSV. Then converted it into BGR. The resulting<br>histogram image is multiplied with this color map. He also uses some preprocessing steps to remove<br>small isolated pixels, resulting in a good histogram.</p>
<p>I leave it to the readers to run the code, analyze it and have your own hack arounds. Below is the<br>output of that code for the same image as above:</p>
<p><img src="/images/2dhist_opencv.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>You can clearly see in the histogram what colors are present, blue is there, yellow is there, and<br>some white due to chessboard is there. Nice !!!</p>
