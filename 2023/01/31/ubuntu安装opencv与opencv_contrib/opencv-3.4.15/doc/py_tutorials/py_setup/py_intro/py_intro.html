<h1 id="Introduction-to-OpenCV-Python-Tutorials-tutorial-py-intro"><a href="#Introduction-to-OpenCV-Python-Tutorials-tutorial-py-intro" class="headerlink" title="Introduction to OpenCV-Python Tutorials {#tutorial_py_intro}"></a>Introduction to OpenCV-Python Tutorials {#tutorial_py_intro}</h1><h2 id="OpenCV"><a href="#OpenCV" class="headerlink" title="OpenCV"></a>OpenCV</h2><p>OpenCV was started at Intel in 1999 by <strong>Gary Bradsky</strong>, and the first release came out in 2000.<br><strong>Vadim Pisarevsky</strong> joined Gary Bradsky to manage Intel’s Russian software OpenCV team. In 2005,<br>OpenCV was used on Stanley, the vehicle that won the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge. Later, its active<br>development continued under the support of Willow Garage with Gary Bradsky and Vadim Pisarevsky<br>leading the project. OpenCV now supports a multitude of algorithms related to Computer Vision and<br>Machine Learning and is expanding day by day.</p>
<p>OpenCV supports a wide variety of programming languages such as C++, Python, Java, etc., and is<br>available on different platforms including Windows, Linux, OS X, Android, and iOS. Interfaces for<br>high-speed GPU operations based on CUDA and OpenCL are also under active development.</p>
<p>OpenCV-Python is the Python API for OpenCV, combining the best qualities of the OpenCV C++ API and<br>the Python language.</p>
<h2 id="OpenCV-Python"><a href="#OpenCV-Python" class="headerlink" title="OpenCV-Python"></a>OpenCV-Python</h2><p>OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems.</p>
<p>Python is a general purpose programming language started by <strong>Guido van Rossum</strong> that became very<br>popular very quickly, mainly because of its simplicity and code readability. It enables the<br>programmer to express ideas in fewer lines of code without reducing readability.</p>
<p>Compared to languages like C&#x2F;C++, Python is slower. That said, Python can be easily extended with<br>C&#x2F;C++, which allows us to write computationally intensive code in C&#x2F;C++ and create Python wrappers<br>that can be used as Python modules. This gives us two advantages: first, the code is as fast as the<br>original C&#x2F;C++ code (since it is the actual C++ code working in background) and second, it easier to<br>code in Python than C&#x2F;C++. OpenCV-Python is a Python wrapper for the original OpenCV C++<br>implementation.</p>
<p>OpenCV-Python makes use of <strong>Numpy</strong>, which is a highly optimized library for numerical operations<br>with a MATLAB-style syntax. All the OpenCV array structures are converted to and from Numpy arrays.<br>This also makes it easier to integrate with other libraries that use Numpy such as SciPy and<br>Matplotlib.</p>
<h2 id="OpenCV-Python-Tutorials"><a href="#OpenCV-Python-Tutorials" class="headerlink" title="OpenCV-Python Tutorials"></a>OpenCV-Python Tutorials</h2><p>OpenCV introduces a new set of tutorials which will guide you through various functions available in<br>OpenCV-Python. <strong>This guide is mainly focused on OpenCV 3.x version</strong> (although most of the<br>tutorials will also work with OpenCV 2.x).</p>
<p>Prior knowledge of Python and Numpy is recommended as they won’t be covered in this guide.<br><strong>Proficiency with Numpy is a must in order to write optimized code using OpenCV-Python.</strong></p>
<p>This tutorial was originally started by <em>Abid Rahman K.</em> as part of the Google Summer of Code 2013<br>program under the guidance of <em>Alexander Mordvintsev</em>.</p>
<h2 id="OpenCV-Needs-You"><a href="#OpenCV-Needs-You" class="headerlink" title="OpenCV Needs You !!!"></a>OpenCV Needs You !!!</h2><p>Since OpenCV is an open source initiative, all are welcome to make contributions to the library,<br>documentation, and tutorials. If you find any mistake in this tutorial (from a small spelling<br>mistake to an egregious error in code or concept), feel free to correct it by cloning OpenCV in<br><a href="https://github.com/opencv/opencv">GitHub</a> and submitting a pull request. OpenCV developers will<br>check your pull request, give you important feedback and (once it passes the approval of the<br>reviewer) it will be merged into OpenCV. You will then become an open source contributor :-)</p>
<p>As new modules are added to OpenCV-Python, this tutorial will have to be expanded. If you are<br>familiar with a particular algorithm and can write up a tutorial including basic theory of the<br>algorithm and code showing example usage, please do so.</p>
<p>Remember, we <strong>together</strong> can make this project a great success !!!</p>
