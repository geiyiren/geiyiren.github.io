<p>This module is focused on the image processing using fuzzy mathematics, namely fuzzy (F)-transform. The F-transform technique approximates input function, where only few input values are known. The technique of F-transform takes local areas as areas with some additional structure. This structure is characterized by fuzzy predicates that may express any information which is relevant for a problem. In image processing, this can be, for example, a distance from a certain point, a relationship between points, color&#x2F;intensity, texture, etc.</p>
<p>The F-transform is a technique putting a continuous&#x2F;discrete function into a correspondence with a finite vector of its F-transform components. In image processing, where images are identified with intensity functions of two arguments, the F-transform of the latter is given by a matrix of components. The module currently covering F0-trasnform, where components are scalars.</p>
<p>The components can be used for inverse F-transform, where approximated input function is obtained. If input function (image) includes some damaged or missing areas, these areas are recomputed and restored after invesre F-transform processing.</p>

<p>Investigation of the F-transform technique leads to several applications in image processing. Currently investigated are image inpainting, filtering, resampling, edge detection, compression and image fusion.</p>
<p>The module covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>F0 processing (fuzzy_F0_math.cpp): Functions for computation of the image F0 components and inverse F0-transform.</li>
<li>Fuzzy image processing (fuzzy_image.cpp): Functions aimed to image processing currently including image inpainting and image filtering.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also tests in test_image.cpp using resources from opencv_extra, and samples in fuzzy_inpainting.cpp and fuzzy_filtering.cpp.</p>
